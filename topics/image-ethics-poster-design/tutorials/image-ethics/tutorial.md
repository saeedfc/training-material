## Image ethics?

The image ethics part handles on the theoretical aspects of image manipulation, the mistakes people make and how to avoid image fraud. 
VIB has guidelines for acceptable scientific image manipulations. Not all manipulations are scientifically correct. 
There are manipulations that fall within the scope of scientific misconduct, because they result in misrepresentation of the data. 
Such misrepresentation makes it impossible for others to interpret the data correctly, or worse, leads to conclusions that are not correct.
