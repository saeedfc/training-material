## How to design a poster?

The second part of this course deals with poster design. Scientific posters are a resume of a piece or timespan of research on one square meter of paper. 
They are best compared to slides for oral presentations, not a written document. Posters canâ€™t convey detailed evidence like scientific articles, it must visualize a message on its own. 
When standing a meter away from a poster you hardly feel like reading much text, especially when the author/designer stands next to it. 
A poster must bring that message without requiring oral explanation, but with as little text as possible.
