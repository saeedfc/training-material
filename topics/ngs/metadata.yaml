title: "Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis" 
summary: "This page is dedicated to the series of trainings that will lead you through the various workflows for the analysis of next generation sequencing data."

subtopics:
  - id: introduction 
    title: "Introduction to the analysis of NGS data"
    description: "This training gives you the background knowledge you need to follow the more advanced trainings on variant analysis, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq."
  - id: variant-analysis 
    title: "NGS Variant Analysis"
    description: "
- Use the graphical environment provided by the BITS GenePattern server to perform all steps of a classical NGS variant workflow and feel the complexity of the task.
- Perform a simplified analysis workflow including read mapping, variant calling against the current human reference genome
- Annotate the obtained variant calls and compare them to the public variant file for that genome.
- implicitly get the motivation to go to the next level and learn command line and R"

    title: "ChIP-Seq analysis"
    description: "The aim of this session is to :
- Have an understanding of the nature of ChIP-Seq data
- Perform a complete analysis workflow including QC, read mapping, visualization in a genome browser and peak-calling
- Use the GenePattern platform for each step of the workflow and feel the complexity of the task
- Have an overview of possible downstream analyses
- Perform a motif analysis with online web programs"
