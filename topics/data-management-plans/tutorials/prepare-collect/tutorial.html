<h3 id="introduction-to-data-collection">Introduction to data collection</h3>

<p>By now you will have obtained some idea of what research data management is all about. Now we will have a more in-depth look into the different phases of your research by starting with data collection.</p>

<p>Data collection involves understanding the different types of data you collect. Depending on the nature of your research, there are different methods of collecting data and thus different types of data.</p>

<p>Your data may be physical (paper records or archival forms) or digital (database contents or Excel data). The source of your data may be external, you collect it yourself or you generate it from a machine.</p>

<p>When you write your data management plan you will need to take into account the type of data you collect, the source of the data, and how you will process and analyse your data.</p>

<p>You can watch the video below, provided by TU Delft, about data collection. The video stops at 1:12.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqnVrnVdv2Y" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" height="515px" style="display: inline-block;" width="800px" title=""></iframe>

<h3 id="preferred-formats-for-your-research-data">Preferred formats for your research data</h3>

<p>This e-module is based on the online Research Data Management training ‘MANTRA’ of The University of Edinburgh (CC BY: <a href="https://mantra.edina.ac.uk/">https://mantra.edina.ac.uk/</a>) and Managing Data @ Melbourne</p>

<figure id="figure-2"><img src="../../images/01_Preferred-formats_Learning_Objective.png" alt="Introduction " /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 2:</span> Learning objectives</figcaption></figure>

<p>The file formats you use to generate your research data will influence how you can manage them over time, i.e. a program or application must be able to recognise the file format in order to access your data within the file.
For example, a web browser is able to process and display a file in the HTML file format so that it appears as a web page. If the browser encounters another file type, it may need to call on a special plug-in to view it. Or it may simply let you download the file to view if it can recognise it in another program.</p>

<p>To identify the file format, files usually have a file name extension, or suffix that follows a full stop in the file name and contains three or four letters, like for example:</p>

<p>TODO: add PDF with links to preferred file formats</p>
<ul>
  <li>.txt    text</li>
  <li>.pdf    portable document format</li>
  <li>.jpg    joint photographic experts group</li>
  <li>.csv    comma separated values</li>
  <li>.html   hypertext markup language</li>
  <li>.xml  extensible markup language</li>
  <li>.rtf  rich text format</li>
</ul>

<p>While file conversion or migration sometimes has to be done, there are also risks.</p>

[[X]] special characters and end of line returns may change
[[X]] relation among items in a table and among tables may be lost
[[X]] layers, color fidelity and resolution may be lost or changed in image files
[[X]] fonts, footnotes and links to other documents may change
[[X]] frame rate, sound quality, codecs and wrappers may be altered in multimedia files
[[X]] last characters in rows (due to row size limitations) may be altered</p>

<p>TODO: block</p>

<h3 id="describe-what-kind-of-data-you-will-generate">Describe what kind of data you will generate</h3>

<p>Having a clear view of what data you will generate will enable you to plan its management. You can create an overview of the data you produce or collect by drawing the data in a workflow, or noting down in a table.</p>

<p>Please watch the video below. Tessa Pronk will explain to you how to describe your data.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KE2UpZY4wYA" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" height="515px" style="display: inline-block;" width="800px" title=""></iframe>

<p>TODO: add H5P quiz</p>

<h3 id="copyright-and-intellectual-property-rights-ipr-issues">Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues</h3>

<p>Copyright is a form of intellectual property right which arises automatically if an original work is created. Copyright may affect the way data may be stored, shared and reused. You should ask yourself who the copyright holder of your datasets is, especially when you use existing data or when you collaborate with external parties.</p>

<p><strong>Using someone else’s research data</strong>
SURF provides a brief guide to determining what consent is necessary to reuse someone else’s data (see “A brief guide … someone else’s data” in the resources below)</p>

<p><strong>Clarifying the ownership of your research data</strong></p>

<p>TODO: change accordingly for VIB</p>

<p>Officially VIB, as your employer, is considered the rights holder to the research data you create. You, as a researcher, have the primary responsibility for taking care of the data. Questions on data exploitation may be even more important than those of ownership. Who can use the data? Who can publish it? Who can provide it to third parties?</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you deal with the issues around data exploitation at an early stage of your research project. Write down agreements between yourself, your supervisor, project members and other interested parties in your Data Management Plan.</p>

<p>TODO: change accordingly</p>

<p>RDM Support offers you a Guide to legal instruments and agreements for research data management (see the Guide ‘Legal instruments and agreements’)</p>

<p><strong>Confidential or privacy-sensitive data</strong>
When your research project has received data under confidentiality or under legal privacy restrictions, you will have to identify and explain how you will deal with these restrictions in your data management plan (also see ‘Learning Unit: Handle - Data security’).</p>

<h3 id="costs-involved-with-managing-your-data">Costs involved with managing your data</h3>

<p>Check
https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/costs-of-data-management</p>

<p>The costs of data management and sharing activities must be included into your research, in terms of time and resources needed.</p>

<p><strong>1. Data Management Cost Guide</strong></p>

<p>When you plan your research you may not be able to oversee all costs involved. Nevertheless, it is useful to have an idea of possible costs at an early stage. You can use the Guide ‘Costs of Data Management’, which is a practical overview of possible costs per activity within each phase of the research process. Note: The Cost Guide offers cost indications and examples. These are not real prices.</p>

<p><strong>2. Budget your data management costs</strong></p>

<p>You are advised to budget the data management costs as separate data management costs. These costs are eligible for funding with funders like NWO and the European Commission, as long as the costs are invoiced before the end of the project.</p>

<p><strong>3. Planning can save time and money</strong></p>

<p>Planning an early start for certain activities within your research project can lower the costs for data management in the run of your project. You can save time by:</p>

<p>Properly describing your data while collecting it, instead of doing it afterwards
Choosing the right file format so that file conversion afterwards is not necessary
Hiring an experienced data manager
Spending time to think about data activities beforehand can help prevent unexpected extra efforts and costs later on in your research project.</p>

<h3 id="check-the-current-and-expected-costs-for-your-research-data">Check the current and expected costs for your research data</h3>

<p>You have just learned that in many parts of a research project there are data related costs. These costs depend on the type and volume of data you produce, analyse and store.</p>

<h3 id="write-your-data-management-plan-for-your-data-collection">Write your data management plan for your data collection</h3>

<p>Go to DMPonline and open your draft data management plan created in the Introduction.</p>

<p>You have now completed the module Data collection. You should be able to complete the following questions in the section Data collection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will you use existing data?</li>
  <li>What data will you collect or create?</li>
  <li>How will the data be collected or created?</li>
  <li>How will you manage rights issues?</li>
  <li>What are the costs involved in managing and storing your data?</li>
</ul>
