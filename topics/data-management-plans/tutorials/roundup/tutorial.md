### Introduction to rounding up

You have almost reached the end of this course on research data management.

You have learned about data collection, data documentation, data storage and security, selection and preservation and making data available for reuse.

We are very curious to know if this course has helped you write your Data Management Plan (DMP).

To round up:

* We want to remind you of the DMP review service of RDM Support;
* We want to share some good practices of data management with you;
* We invite you to fill out the evaluation of this online training. This will help us to further develop this training and future learners can benefit from this. Thank you very much!

### DMP review service

You can have your data management plan (DMP) checked by the specialists of Research Data Management Support. You can get in touch if you are unsure about sections in your DMP or when you doubt whether your plan fits the requirements of your research funder.

When you are in the process of writing a proposal for a research funder and you want a check on the data section, you can also contact the Research Support Office (RSO) of your faculty.

Challenges in irreproducible research
special issue in Nature, 7 Oct 2015

There is growing alarm about results that cannot be reproduced.  Explanations include increased levels of scrutiny, complexity of experiments and statistics, and pressures on researchers. Journals, scientists, institutions and funders all have a part in tackling reproducibility. Nature has taken substantive steps to improve the transparency and robustness in what they publish, and to promote awareness within the scientific community.

Advantages of data sharing
by John-Alan Pascoe of Delft University of Technology

John-Alan Pascoe, researcher at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, explains the advantages he experienced after sharing his raw and derived data in the data archive of 4TU.ResearchData.
