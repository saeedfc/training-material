<p>In my qPCR experiment I want to study the expression of 12 genes of interest in 8 samples of interest. I want to use 2 PCR replicates for each reaction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many 96 well plates do I need for this experiment ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have 12 genes in 8 samples which gives a total of 96 reactions (one plate). I want to perform each reaction twice (2 PCR replicates) so I need two plates. However, I need to include reference genes in my experiment, preferably more than one. I can put these reference genes on a separate plate, I do not have to include them on each plate.
Ideally, you need to include 3 reference genes so having 8 samples and 2 replicates this gives an additional 48 reactions. Thus, I need three 96 well plates to perform this experiment.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-3-how-to-fill-plates-">Exercise 3: how to fill plates ?</h3>

<p>In my qPCR experiment I want to study the pattern of expression of 5 genes (genes of interest and reference genes) in 38 samples (samples of interest and control samples). I want to use 2 PCR replicates for each reaction.</p>

<p>| What is the minimum number of 96 well plates I need for this experiment ? |
| :â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” |
| 5 genes * 38 samples * 2 replicates = 380 reactions.
I need a minimum of 4 plates for this experiment.</p>

<p>Suppose thereâ€™s only one 96-well plate left in your lab. You have 10 samples (samples of interest + control samples) and you want to make the most of what you have.</p>

<p>| How many genes of interest would you measure ? |
| :â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” |
| Since you want to make most of what you have, letâ€™s assume you are omitting PCR replicates.
Theoretically, you could fit 9 genes on your 96-well plate. However, to avoid pipetting mistakes I would measure only 8 genes so I can work with one row / gene. This is very handy for multichannel pipets.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-4-a-growing-study">Exercise 4: a growing study</h3>

<p>In my qPCR experiment I want to study the pattern of expression of 24 genes (genes of interest and reference genes) in 48 samples (samples of interest and control samples). I want to use 2 PCR replicates for each reaction.</p>

<p>| How many genes can I analyze on one 384 well plate ? |
| :â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” |
| 48 samples * 2 replicates = 96 reactions per gene.
I can analyze 4 genes on each 384 well plate.</p>

<p>Each week I receive 2 additional samples to analyze.</p>

<p>| Do I analyze them immediately after I get them ? |
| :â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” |
| No. Since the samples are placed on different plates as in the previous experiment, you have to use IRCs. You typically need 3 IRCs and a no template control sample. It means that if you want to analyze these 2 samples you have to include 4 additional samples for each gene. This is a lot of overhead for just 2 samples !
Try to avoid this: itâ€™s better to wait a few weeks until you have 6 or 8 or even more samples.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-5-a-diagnostic-copy-number-screen">Exercise 5: a diagnostic copy number screen</h3>

<p>In diagnostic screens all samples are important: you cannot leave out samples and all measurements need to be of the highest quality possible. In my qPCR experiment I want to study copy number variation of 16 genes
(genes of interest and reference genes) and 2 calibrator samples (samples with known copy number). Since we need high quality data we will use 4 technical replicates.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Are we going to use sample maximization ?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">No. In contrast to gene expression studies, where we want to compare expression levels of a gene between different groups of samples, copy number analyses do compare genes. It means that in this case the sample maximization approach (placing all samples of the same gene on the same plate) is not valid. Instead we use a gene maximization approach here (placing same sample for different genes on the same plate).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>| How many samples can I fit on a 384 well plate ? |
| :â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” |
| We have 16 (genes) * 4 (replicates) = 64 reactions per sample.
This means that we can fit 6 samples on a 384 well plate: 4 unknowns and 2 calibrators.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-6-fix-experiments-with-bad-or-missing-data">Exercise 6: fix experiments with bad or missing data</h3>

<p>In my qPCR experiment I want to study gene expression of 6 genes (3 genes of interest and 3 reference genes) in 20 samples (samples of interest and control samples).
