    summary: "The outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on the parameter settings. IPO (`Isotopologue Parameter Optimization`) is a parameter optimization tool that is applicable for different kinds of samples and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of labeling steps. IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing the relative retention time differences within features and grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of features showing exactly one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiment. The resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models."

    summary: "mz.unity is an R package for detecting and exploring complex relationships in accurate-mass mass spectrometry data. Mz.unity implements a combiunatorial search which can be tailored to many specific relationships. These include simple relationships like isotopes, charge carriers, and common neutral losses but also complex relationships such as distal fragments, mers, and background mers."

    summary: "ProteoWizard provides a set of open-source, cross-platform software libraries and tools (e.g. msconvert, Skyline, IDPicker, SeeMS) that facilitate proteomics data analysis. The libraries enable rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable development framework that simplifies and unifies data file access, and performs standard chemistry and LCMS dataset computations."

    link: "https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/"
    summary: "SIRIUS is a new java-based software framework for discovering a landscape of de-novo identification of metabolites using single and tandem mass spectrometry. SIRIUS uses isotope pattern analysis for detecting the molecular formula and further analyses the fragmentation pattern of a compound using fragmentation trees. Fragmentation trees can be uploaded to CSI:FingerID via a web service, and results can be displayed in the SIRIUS graphical user interface. (This is also possible using the command line version of SIRIUS.) This is the recommended way of using CSI:FingerID."
