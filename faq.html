<h1 id="overview-questions">Overview Questions</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-this-website">What is this website?</h2>

<p>This website is a collection of hands-on tutorials that are designed to be interactive and are built around Galaxy:</p>

<figure id="figure-1"><img src="shared/images/interactive_training.png" alt="Interactive training" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 1:</span> The hands-on nature of our training material. It can be used with two web browser windows open side-by-side, one pointed at the current tutorial and the other at a Galaxy instance</figcaption></figure>

<p>This material is developed and maintained by the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">worldwide Galaxy community</a>. You can learn more about this effort by reading our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.012">article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-galaxy">What is Galaxy?</h2>

<p><a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy</a> is an open data integration and analysis platform for the life sciences, and it is particularly well-suited for data analysis training in life science research.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-tutorials-for">What are the tutorials for?</h2>

<p>These tutorials can be used for learning and teaching how to use Galaxy for general data analysis, and for learning/teaching specific domains such as assembly and differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data.</p>

<h2 id="what-audiences-are-the-tutorials-for">What audiences are the tutorials for?</h2>

<p>There are two distinct audiences for these materials.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Self-paced individual learners.</strong> These tutorials provide everything you need to learn a topic, from explanations of concepts to detailed hands-on exercises.</li>
  <li><strong>Instructors.</strong> They are also designed to be used by instructors in teaching/training settings. Slides, and detailed tutorials are provided. Most tutorials also include computational support with the needed tools, data as well as Docker images that can be used to scale the lessons up to many participants.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-is-the-content-licensed">How is the content licensed?</h2>

<h2 id="how-can-i-cite-this-project">How can I cite this project?</h2>

<p>We wrote an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.012">article</a> about our efforts.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-advertise-the-training-materials-on-my-posters">How can I advertise the training materials on my posters?</h2>

<p>We provide some QR codes and logos in the <a href="https://github.com/vibbits/training-material/tree/master/assets/images">images folder</a>.</p>

<h1 id="for-individual-learners">For Individual Learners</h1>

<p>Learning Galaxy and data analysis on your own and at your own pace?  This material is for you.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-start">Where do I start?</h2>

<p>If you are new to Galaxy then start with one of the introductory topics.  These introduce you to concepts that are useful in Galaxy, no matter what domain you are doing analysis in.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with Galaxy basics and want to learn how to use it in a particular domain (for example, ChIP-Seq), then start with one of those topics.</p>

<p>If you are already well informed about bioinformatics data analysis and you just want to get a feel for how it works in Galaxy, then many tutorials include <em>Instructions for the impatient</em> sections.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this-material">How do I use this material?</h2>

<p>Many topics include slide decks and if the topic you are interested in has slides then start there.  These will introduce the topic and important concepts.</p>

<p>Most of your learning will happen in the next step - the hands-on tutorials.  This is where you’ll become familiar with using the Galaxy interface and experiment with different ways to use Galaxy and the tools in Galaxy.</p>

<h2 id="where-can-i-run-the-hands-on-tutorials">Where can I run the hands-on tutorials?</h2>

<p>To run the hands-on tutorials you need a Galaxy server to run them on.</p>

<p>Each tutorial is annotated with information about which <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/">public Galaxy servers</a> it can be run on. These servers are available to anyone on the world wide web and some may have all the tools that are needed by a specific tutorial.</p>

<p>Some topics have a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image that can be installed and run on participants’ laptops.  These Docker images contain Galaxy instances that include all tools and datasets used in a tutorial, as well as saved analyses and repeatable workflows that are relevant. You will need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">install Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also run your tutorials on cloud-based infrastructures.  Galaxy is <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/galaxy-services/">available on many national research infrastructures</a> such as <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/jetstream/">Jetstream</a> (United States), <a href="https://www.genap.ca/">GenAP</a> (Canada), <a href="https://www.gvl.org.au/">GVL</a> (Australia), <a href="http://www.climb.ac.uk/">CLIMB</a> (United Kingdom), and more.  These instances are typically easy to launch, and easy to shut down when you are done.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with, and have an account on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> then you can also launch a Galaxy server there using <a href="https://launch.usegalaxy.org/">CloudLaunch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-help">How can I get help?</h2>

<p>If you have questions about this training material, you can reach us using the <a href="">Gitter chat</a>.  You’ll need a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account to post questions.  If you have questions about Galaxy outside the context of training, see the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/support/">Galaxy Support page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="for-instructors">For Instructors</h1>

<p>This material can also be used to teach Galaxy and data analysis in a group setting to students and researchers.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-start-1">Where do I start?</h2>

<p>Spend some time exploring the different tutorials and the different resources that are available. Become familiar with the structure of the tutorials and think about how you might use them in your teaching.</p>

<h2 id="what-galaxy-instance-should-i-use-for-my-training">What Galaxy instance should I use for my training?</h2>

<p>To teach the hands-on tutorials you need a Galaxy server to run the examples on.</p>

<p>Each tutorial is annotated with the information on which <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/">public Galaxy servers</a> it can be run. These servers are available to anyone on the world wide web and some may have all the tools that are needed by a specific tutorial. If you choose this option then you should work with that server’s admins to confirm that think the server can handle the workload for a workshop. For example, the <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/">usegalaxy.eu</a></p>

<p>If your organization/consortia/community has its own Galaxy server, then you may  want to run tutorials on that. This can be ideal because then the instance you are teaching on is the same you your participants will be using after the training. They’ll also be able to revisit any analysis they did during the training. If you pursue this option you’ll need to work with your organization’s Galaxy Admins to confirm that</p>

<ul>
  <li>the server can support a room full of people all doing the same analysis at the same time.</li>
  <li>all participants will be able to create/use accounts on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some training topics have a Docker image that can be installed and run on all participants’ laptops.  These images contain Galaxy instances that include all tools and datasets used in a tutorial, as well as saved analyses and repeatable workflows that are relevant.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also run your tutorials on cloud-based infrastructures.  Galaxy is <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/galaxy-services/">available on many national research infrastructures</a> such as <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/jetstream/">Jetstream</a> (United States), <a href="https://www.genap.ca/">GenAP</a> (Canada), <a href="https://launch.genome.edu.au/launch">GVL</a> (Australia), <a href="http://www.climb.ac.uk/">CLIMB</a> (United Kingdom), and more.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-help">How do I get help?</h2>

<p>The support channel for instructors is the same as for individual learners.  We suggest you start by posting a question to the Galaxy Training Network <a href="">Gitter chat</a>. Anyone can view the discussion, but you’ll need to login (using your GitHub or Twitter account) to add to the discussion.</p>

<p>If you have questions about Galaxy in general (that are not training-centric) then there are <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/support/">several support options</a>.</p>

<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>

<p>First off, thanks for your interest in contributing to the Galaxy training materials!</p>

<p>Individual learners and instructors can make these training more effective by contributing back to them. You can report mistakes and errors, create more content, etc. Whatever is your background, there is a way to contribute: via the GitHub website, via command-line or even without dealing with GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-started-with-contributing">How can I get started with contributing?</h2>

<p>If you would like to get involved in the project but are unsure where to start, there are some easy ways to contribute which will also help you familiarize yourself with the project.</p>

<h3 id="1-checking-existing-tutorials">1. Checking existing tutorials</h3>

</ul>

<h2 id="how-can-i-give-feedback">How can I give feedback?</h2>

<p>At the end of each tutorial, there is a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BILuBp8bPv42odpZ55Kcf2rqzR-k0Czx46agVVSRgm4/edit">a feedback form</a>. We use this information to improve our tutorials.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-test-an-interactive-tour">How can I test an Interactive Tour?</h2>

<p>Perhaps you’ve been asked to review an interactive tour, or maybe you just want to try one out. The easiest way to run an interactive tour is to use the <a href="https://tailordev.fr/blog/2017/07/19/the-galaxy-tour-builder-extension/">Tour builder</a> browser extension.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the Tour Builder extension to your browser (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/galaxy-tour-builder/mdfbapknmcpnbmggahhaegehbbbmhmgg">Chrome Web Store</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/galaxy-tour-builder/">Firefox add-on</a>, <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/galaxy-tour-builder/">Opera add-on</a>).</li>
  <li>Navigate to a Galaxy instance supporting the tutorial. To find which Galaxy instances support each tutorial, please see the dropdown menu next to the tutorial on the training website. Using one of the usegalaxy.* instances (<a href="https://usegalaxy.org">Galaxy Main</a>, <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu">Galaxy Europe</a>, or <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au">Galaxy Australia</a>
) is usually a good bet.</li>
  <li>Start the Tour Builder plugin by clicking on the icon in your browser menu bar</li>
  <li>Copy the contents of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tour.yaml</code> file into the Tour builder editor window</li>
  <li>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code> and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the content is written in <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a> with some metadata (or variables) found in <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> files. Everything is stored on our <a href="https://github.com/vibbits/training-material">GitHub repository</a>. Each training material is related to a topic. All training materials (slides, tutorials, etc) related to a topic are found in a dedicated directory (<em>e.g.</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">transcriptomics</code> directory contains the material related to transcriptomic analysis). Each topic has the following <a name="structure">structure</a>:</p>

<p><img src="shared/images/repo_organization.png" alt="Structure of the repository" width="400px" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>a metadata file in YAML format</li>
  <li>a directory with the topic introduction slide deck in Markdown with introductions to the topic</li>
  <li>
    <p>a directory with the tutorials:</p>

    <p>Inside the tutorials directory, each tutorial related to the topic has its own subdirectory with several files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a tutorial file written in Markdown with hands-on</li>
      <li>an optional slides file in Markdown with slides to support the tutorial</li>
      <li>a directory with Galaxy Interactive Tours to reproduce the tutorial</li>
      <li>a directory with workflows extracted from the tutoria</li>
      <li>a YAML file with the links to the input data needed for the tutorial</li>
      <li>a YAML file with the description of needed tools to run the tutorial</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a directory with the Dockerfile describing the details to build a container for the topic (self-study environments).</li>
</ul>
